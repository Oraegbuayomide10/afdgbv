                <h3>
                    The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated existing inequalities within countries and across geographies.
                    With half the world under lockdown as governments’ response to COVID 19, GBV increased significantly.
                    This increase was due to the intersection of marginalization and discrimination which 
                    made certain groups of women more susceptible to GBV and COVID 19 pandemics. <br> These intersecting 
                    social identities of vulnerability need equal attention in order to eradicate inequality.

                     integrated into the NPA VAWC and accelerate the country’s progress as envisioned in the National Five

                        Some Laws and Policies were prepared in the late 1990’s
                        to address specifically gender equality and women’s interests.
                         Of these Laws and Policies is the; <br>
                        - Sexual

                        - and the Women in Development and Gender Policy, 2000. <br>

                        Evidence shows that despite the existence of these Laws and Policies, 
                        gender inequality is still widespread in the country because of existing 
                        gaps and limited enforcement of the Laws and inadequate implementation of the Policies.
