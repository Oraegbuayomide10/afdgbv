                   (A) The statistical data produced by the services of the General Directorate of National 
                  Security (DGSN), which collate data on a quarterly and annual basis of all
                   complaints lodged by women aged 18 and over classifies cases of violence on the one hand
                   by type of violence,
                   according to 5 categories: <br>
                   
                   (I) Physical violence; <br>
                    (II) Sexual violence; <br>
                     (III) Ill-treatment; <br>
                      (IV)  Murders; <br>
                        (V) Sexual harassment <br>
                        
                        On the other hand by type of aggressor according 
                    to the 
                  relationship with the victim: <br>
                  
                  (I) Husband; <br>
                    (II)  Father; <br>
                   (III) Brother; <br>
                     (IV)  Son; <br>
                     (V)   Lovers and others <br>

                     <br>




                    (B) During the third trimester of 2001, a survey undertaken by the
                     police of 42 wilaya (prefectures) found;
                     
                     (I) 1,439 women victims of violence, <br>
                     (II) 1,087 cases of assault, <br> 
                     (III) 50 cases of sexual violence, <br>
                     (IV) 267 cases of abuse, <br> 
                      (V)  4 murder cases and <br> 
                       (VI) 31 cases of sexual harassment. <br>
                       <br>
                       (I) In 12 percent of those cases, the offender was the victim’s husband; <br>
                      (II) In 1 percent, the father; <br>
                      (III) In 3 percent, the brother; <br>
                      (IV) In 2 percent, 
                     the son; <br>
                     (V) In 3 per cent, the partner. <br>

                     <br>




                    (C) According to a national survey on violence against women carried out in 2002-2003
                      by the National Institute of Public Health and published in 2005, it was discovered that; <br>

                     (I) One in two women is between 23 and 40 years old. <br>
                     
                     (II) 26.8% are illiterate, 2% of average level, 19.8% of secondary level and 5.6% of higher 
                     level. <br>
                     
                     (III) In three quarters of the cases, the victim is assaulted in the 
                     marital home, mostly by the husband. <br>
                     
                     (IV) The majority of victims (72.3%)
                      are unemployed 5% of sexual violence including 2.5% qualified as rape. <br>
                       
                      (V) The study confirms that women belonging to disadvantaged categories
                        of society were more vulnerable. <br>

                        <br>



                      (D) In 2006, the Delegate Minister for the Family and the Status of Women commissioned
                      a National Survey on Violence Against Women, based on interviews with a sample 
                      of 2,043 women aged 19‑64 years. The survey found that: <br>
                      
                      (I) Women are most likely to be subjected to violence within the family
                       and it revealed significant prevalence rates. <br>

                        (II) One in 10 women living with their husband or partner reported to be 
                        subjected “often” or “daily” to physical violence such as beatings, 
                        locking in or ejecting into the street during the last 12 months prior 
                        to the survey. <br>
                        
                        (III) One in three women (31.4 per cent) reported to have
                         been regularly subjected to threats of physical or emotional violence in 
                         the same period. <br>
                         
                         (IV) 10.9 per cent of women with a husband or cohabitant 
                         partner had been subject to forced sexual relations on more than one occasion. <br>

                         (V)   Women who are divorced, widowed or separated from their husbands are 
                         particularly likely to become victims of violence at the hands of both in
                          laws and blood relations. Deprived of the husband’s support in the family
                           structure, these women often find themselves in a particularly precarious
                            situation. <br>
                            
                            (VI) Women with less education or poor women were more likely to 
                            suffer violence and thereby underscored the fact that women’s educational 
                            and socio economic empowerment must form an integral part of any strategy 
                            to combat violence against women. <br>
                            
                            (VII) 7 per cent of all women have been 
                            sexually harassed in an educational or training institution and 1.9 per cent
                             have even suffered sexual violence; <br>
                             
                             (VIII) 1.6 per cent of women reported
                              sexual harassment at work and another 1 per cent was subjected to sexual 
                              violence.

             (A) The Ministry of Family and Promotion of Women created a Family Counselling Centre in 2000,
              which provides legal assistance to the public, educating and informing them on their rights,
               and giving psycho-social assistance to victims of violence. In February 2001,
               a cooperation agreement was signed between the Lawyers’ Association of Angola and
                the Ministry of Family and Promotion of Women with the aim of assigning Lawyers to 
                the Family Counselling Centre in order to provide legal assistance to victims of 
                violence or persons directly and indirectly involved. This work of attending 
             to the victims of violence is also done at the level of all provinces of the country. <br>

             (B) The Angolan Women Organisation set up the Legal Counselling Centre in 1986. 
             It has offices in four provinces: Benguela, Luanda, Cbinda and Huila. The center 
             provides the following kind of services: <br>
             (I) Advice to women and men who are victims
              of abuse; <br>
              (II) Advice about sexual abuse and rapes; <br>
              (III) Support in dealings with the police, 
                the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the courts; <br>
                (IV) Educational efforts on
               issues of equality between men and women; <br>
               (V) Seminars in training on the causes and
                effects of violence, 
             and on the principal rules and standards related to human rights. <br>

             (C) To ensure that cases of violence against women are investigated exhaustively, 
             a Domestic Violence Section has been set up within 
             the National Criminal Investigation Directorate, to deal with complaints of domestic violence. <br>

             (D) The purpose of Angola’s Family Counseling Centers is to; <br>
              
              (I) Provide legal assistance to people; <br>
               (II) To educate and inform them of their rights, <br>
               (III) To provide psychosocial assistance to victims 
              of violence.

        Demography (INSD) in 2008 on the entire Burkinabese population revealed that: <br>
        
        (I) In matters of domestic violence, 71% of women think that a husband has the right to hit or beat his wife
         / partner when she neglects children, goes out without it prevent, stand up to him in discussions,
         burn food or refuse sex. <br>

                    The Eritrean Population and Health Survey (EPHS) 2010 collected information from all
                     eligible men and women between 15 and 49 years of age regarding the knowledge, attitudes,
                      and practice of Female Genital Mutilation/ Cutting (FGM/C) in Eritrea. This survey aimed to
                       further investigate the prevalence of and attitudes towards FGM/C among Eritrean women and
                        girls along with assessing whether there was evidence of a change in attitudes or behaviors
                         regarding FGM/C since EDHS1995 and EDHS2002. The EPHS 2010 also gathered information on

             </p>  <hr>
             (A)  According to the World Report on Violence and Health, sexual violence is defined as “any sexual act,
              attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, 
              against a person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim,
               in any setting, including but not limited to home and work. <br> The results of this study indicate that violence
                against female children is highly prevalent in Swaziland. <br>
                - Approximately 1 in 3 females experienced some form of
                 sexual violence as a child; <br>
                - Nearly 1 in 4 females experienced physical violence as a child; <br>
                - Approximately 3 
                 in 10 females experienced emotional abuse as a child. <br> 
                 - Boyfriends and husbands were the most frequent 
                 perpetrators of sexual violence; male relatives (other than the victims’ father) were the most frequent
                  perpetrators of physical violence; <br>
                  - Female relatives were the most frequent perpetrators of emotional abuse.
                   Incidents of sexual violence most frequently occurred in the home, either the home of the respondent
                    or the home of a friend, relative or neighbor. <br>
                 - Over half of all incidents of child sexual violence 
                    were not reported to anyone, and less than 1 in 7 incidents resulted in a female seeking help from available
                     services.  <font color = "orange">  Females indicated the primary reason for not reporting sexual violence was that they were not
                      aware that what they had experienced was abuse.
                       Many females also reported a fear of abandonment if they 
                      told anyone about the violence they had experienced. These numbers suggest a lack of understanding of what 
                      sexual violence is and how and where to report such incidents.</font>  <br>
                      
                      - In regard to physical violence, in only 1 out 
                      of 5 cases did females seek help from available services, despite the fact that nearly 1 in 4 resulted in
                       injury that was serious enough to consult a doctor. The objectives of this survey were to; <br>
                       (I) Describe
                        the epidemiologic patterns of sexual violence and other forms of violence; <br>
                        
                        (II) Identify potential risk and
                         protective factors for sexual violence; <br>
                         
                         (III) assess the knowledge and utilization of health services
                          available for victims of sexual violence and other forms of violence; <br>
                          (IV) Identify areas for further
                           research; <br>
                           (V) Raise awareness about violence as an important health problem; and  <br>
                           (VI) Make 
                           recommendations on improving and enhancing interventions to better identify, 
             treat and prevent sexual violence against children and its health related consequences.

                (A) In Tunisia we do not yet have specialized training by sector but they have 
                participated in all training since 2006 which focuses particularly on the
                 very notion of violence, on forms and types of violence, on gender and violence; 
                 on human rights and violence against women, gender responsive budgeting and violence.
                 <br>Some specific training courses targeted health professionals relating to the initial
                  medical certificate, specific measures for the care of women victims of violence 
                  in hospitals and emergency services. Training modules have been developed in primary care for women victims of violence.
                <br>

                (B) An epidemiological investigation of 424 cases of women consulting in primary care centers revealed
                that 33.4% of the women interviewed had been beaten at least once during their married life.


                (C) The Tunisian Women's Association for Research and Development (AFTURD) carried out a study
                 entitled "Divorce, violence and women's rights", according to this study, Domestic Violence is

                 the point
                   of being trivialized. <br> 
                   
                   - Between 1990 and June 2000, cases recorded through Tunisia's listening center had a count of
                   about 789 cases of violence. <br> - Between 1990 and 1995 cases of domestic violence
                    were predominant
                     with a percentage of 80%. <br> 
                     - In 1998, this proportion fell to 64.4% in favor of domestic 
                     violence, which went from 4.3% to 14.4%. <br>   
                      The attendance of the counseling 
                      by women victims of violence is justified by the following motives:

                      (I) Expose their case and be listened to;
