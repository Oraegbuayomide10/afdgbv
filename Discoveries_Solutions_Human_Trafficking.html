            A cooperation agreement with three NGOs (AWA, WOPA and ASSEJA)
             aims to ensure that all acts of violence and discrimination against women are reported,
              that trafficking networks are exposed and dismantled and that the police force receives 
              support in caring for and assisting in the reintegration of women victims of violence into
               society and their families. This cooperation also seeks to
             build the capacity of the NGO personnel and facilitate regular exchange of information.<br>

                (A) A National Task Force was organized in 2004 to take coordinated action
                  with the view to tackle trafficking in women and children from the country.
                   The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education 
                   have worked in partnership with the International Organization for
                    Migration (IOM) in several counter-trafficking activities with a 
                    special focus on the prevention aspect. <br>
                
                (B) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established a Women and Children's

                 prosecution of violence with due emphasis on sexual violence. The Ministry has plans 
                 to expand such kind of centers to Dire Dawa city administration and has undertaken the 
                 task of lobbying the officials and assignment of prosecutors exclusively 
                 for such purpose. Steps are being taken to share the same experience with other regional states. <br>

                    (B) Detection,

                     (D) Prevention
                       of further escalation of the crime. <br>

                       These partnerships
                        have resulted into several milestones such as;  <br>
                       (I) Drafting a National Action Plan to combat Trafficking in Persons 
                        (TiP); <br>

             (A) Training was conducted for law enforcement officers especially in key border areas on human trafficking cases 
             in 2005. The objective of this training was to equip
              law enforcement agents with the relevant skills to enable them adequately deal with cases of trafficking. <br>
              (B) In 2004, Government established an Inter-ministerial Committee on Trafficking under
               the Ministry of Home Affairs. The mandate of the Committee is to respond to the problem
                of human trafficking and to develop a preliminary national plan of action which has been completed.
                 It is also mandated to inform individuals about the vices of trafficking and against engaging in trafficking.
                  It is envisaged that these consultations will lead to the development of a policy and appropriate legislation 
                  on human trafficking. The Committee has facilitated the development of a policy on trafficking which is
                   under consideration. <br>
