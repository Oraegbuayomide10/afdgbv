                      The Ugandan Government has developed a National strategy to End Child Marriage 
                      (2014/2015 -2019/2020). The key strategic focus areas of the strategy are;

                      (A) Improved policy and legal 
                      environment to protect children and promotion of the girl childâ€™s 
                      rights; <br>
                      (B) Improved access to quality sexual and reproductive health 
                      services, education, child protection services and other opportunities; <br>

                      (C) Changing dominant thinking and social norms related to child marriage in
                       the communities; <br>
                       
                       (D) Empowerment of both girls and boys with correct information
                        to enable them recognize child marriage and early pregnancy as a gross
                         violation of their rights and take mitigating action; <br>
                         
                         (E) Coordination,
                          monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for the implementation effective of the strategy.
