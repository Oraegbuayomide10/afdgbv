        The Survey on Gender Equality at Home offers a global snapshot of
        life at home, from the perspectives of Facebook users around the
        world. 
        It was conducted in July 2020 to capture household gender
        dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic, and reached a statistically
        representative sample   of half a million people who use Facebook,
        spanning seven world regions and covering 208 countries, territories,
        and islands in 80 languages. <br>
        <hr>

        <br>
        Over 460,000 gave responses to questions in the following areas; <br>
        (A) Attitudes and beliefs about gender equality; <br>
        (B) Participation in unpaid care and domestic work; <br>
        (C) COVID-19â€™s impact on everyday lives; resource allocation 
        and decision-making. <br>
        The survey results were disaggregated for men and women, allowing
        insights into gender differences. <br>
        <br>

        The Pecularity of the Survey <br>
        <hr>
        The findings presented are
        based primarily on responses from 54,922 individuals, including
        20,981 who identified as female and 33,941 who identified as male. 
        This brief does not describe the region as a whole. Rather, results are
        calibrated to the online population in the region. Using the statistics of year
        2017, only about 25 percent of the total Sub-Saharan Africa
        population was using the internet. This population tends to be
        younger (84 percent between 18 and 54 years old), more urban (54
        percent reside in cities), and better educated (43 percent have
        secondary education or higher) than the general population. While
        this limits the generalizability of the findings, the picture that
        emerges provides important insights into gender differences for the
        region.
