                (A) The Ministry of Home Affairs estimates that as many as three out of five women in 
                Botswana have been victims of assault, sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, severe beating,
                 rape, incest, socio-economic abuse, murder, or verbal and emotional abuse. In most instances,
                 the perpetrators of these acts of violence were husbands, boyfriends and male family members.<br>

             (A) In the key findings of the "Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices
              on traditional practices that may perpetuate or protect Namibia 
              from gender-based violence and discrimination" study conducted by 
              the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare in 2008,
               it was found that gender-based violence is still generally tolerated
                in most communities in Namibia. The study revealed that the percentage 
                of those ever subjected to physical abuse was 34% (40.5% females, 27.6% males)
                 while those subjected to mental abuse was 59% (59.5% females, 58.5% males), 
                 and those who have experienced both physical and mental abuse was 69.3%
                  (69.7% females, 68.9% males). Among those interviewed married women are significantly
              more likely to have been subjected to gender-based violence than single women, regardless of age. <br>


              (B) The five types of cases that dominate in all regions are: rape, indecent assaults, 
              attempted rape, assault with attempt to do grievous bodily harm and murders.

            (A) The first Woman and Child Protection Unit was 
            established in 1991 with a directive from the Cabinet. It was mandated to provide a sensitive and 
            integrated response to victims of GBV-related cases (rape, attempted rape, incest, indecent assault,
             abduction and physical abuse of especially women and children). Currently,
              there are 15 Units across the country (2 of the 13 regions have two Units each).
               They are run by the police force who provides protection to the victims. 
               They are also comprised of professionals such as medical doctors, nurses,
                social workers who provide medical services and counselling support to victims of GBV.
               These units are equipped to administer post-exposure prophylaxis for rape victims to 
                prevent HIV infections. They are situated in health institutions (Hospitals/Clinic) 
                and three ministries (Safety and Security, Justice; Gender Equality and Child Welfare; 
                and Health and Social Services). Availability and services delivered are publicly raised
                 to the community through the national radio, national television, local newspapers, posters, 
                 and community meetings. The victims who require medical support/assistance may be referred
                  to the nearest Unit. All gender-based violence victims are served in these centres. <br>
                  The Government of Namibia is planning to upgrade the Women and Child Protection Units into 
                  a "one-stop centre.
             A lot of ground work has been done and the upgrading will soon begin.<br>  
             
             (B) The Zero Tolerance Campaign for GBV was launched by Rt. Hon. Nahas Angula, 
             Prime Minister of the Republic of Namibia on 3 August 2009. The campaign focuses 
             on three main issues: <br> 
             (I) baby dumping,  <br>
             (II) human trafficking and <br>
             (III) Passion killing. <br>
              Different materials were 
             produced: radio drama
              series in different local languages, television adverts, newspaper advertisements, posters and bill boards.

                    (A) During the first half of 2013, there were about 800 cases of sexual violence and gender-based violence
                    reported in Magadishu, the largest capital city of Somalia. Over 1,700 cases of rape were registered in
                     Mogadishu and surrounding areas between January and November 2012. Reports state that approximately one
                      third of victims of sexual violence in Somalia are children. In 2012, 1,220 sexual violence cases were
                       reported from South Central, of which 35% of rape cases
                     were against children. The government acknowledges that the actual number is likely to be much higher.<br>

                 (A) The goal of the National Sexual Assault Policy (2005) is to improve health care after sexual assault for women, 
                 children and men in South Africa. The objectives of the policy are as follows: <br>
                 (I) To establish an institutional framework within the Department of Health to guide the collaboration 
                 and cooperation between different Directorates. <br>
                 (II) To establish designated, specialised, accessible, 
                  24 hour health care service for the hollistic management of patients to improve health status after 
                  sexual assault.<br>
                  (III) To operate as part of an intersectoral service, establishing and maintaining links
                   with the community and key stakeholders at all levels of government and service provision
                    e.g. Department of Safety and Security, South African Police Services (SAPS), Department of
